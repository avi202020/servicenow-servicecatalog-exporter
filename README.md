# ServiceNow ServiceCatalog Exporter

This script will interact with the APIs of a ServiceNow instance and export all
ServiceCatalog catalog items.  The exported items will include any table
extending the `sc_cat_item` `tableâ€¦catalog` items, record producers, content
items, and order guides.

The idea for the logic of this exporter came from a JavaScript based exporter
created by [ServiceNow|Guru][1].

This builds on `SN|Guru` example by being able to export all items from the
ServiceCatatalog and not just a single item.

> TODO: create an importer.  So the export can be transferred to another
> ServiceNow instance.

# What is exported?

In addition to catalog items, the following records related to the exported
catalog item is also exported:

- Variables (including question choices)
- Variable sets (including associated variables, client scripts, and UI
  policies)

ServiceNow ServiceCatalog Exporter

This script will interact with the APIs of a ServiceNow instance and export all
ServiceCatalog catalog items.  The exported items will include any table
extending the 'sc_cat_item' table items.  Including catalog items, record
producers, content items, and order guides.

By default only the most recently created catalog item will be exported.

  exporter.py [--full] [--catalog=<sys_id>] [--instance=<instance>] [-o <file> | --output=<file>]
  exporter.py [--item=<sys_id>] [--instance=<instance>]
  exporter.py (-h | --help)
  exporter.py --version

Options:
  -h --help              Show this screen.
  --version              Show version.
  --full                 Export every ServiceCatalog catalog item.
